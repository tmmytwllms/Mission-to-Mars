# Mission-to-Mars

## Resources
- Software: Visual Studio Code, Python 3.7.9, Google Chrome, Jupyter Notebook, Flask

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to scrape data on Mars from various websites, to create a website that contained all of these elements in a neat display. This website also has the functionality of a scraping button, which will fetch the latest data from the NASA website and display it. VS Code and Jupyter Notebook were used to create a code, in python, to scrape several websites to return several data points. These data points were the most recent article on NASA's website along with the featured photo, facts regarding Mars and Earth, and photos and titles of Mars hemispheres. Flask was then used to create app routes for our website's homepage and scraping page. Lastly, an html layout was created, with Bootstrap elements added for customization, to house and display the scraped data in web format.
